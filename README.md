Gerchbergâ€“Saxton algorithm done in a jupyter notebook (Wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerchberg%E2%80%93Saxton_algorithm).

This small work has been done during the Walkeyrie Winter School 2024, from scratch, under the supervision of Slava Smartsev. It has been tested on generated data for different types of smooth phases, and then has been extended to experimental data taken at IJClab from a 515nm diode laser going through a vortex plate. Results are to be improved, with data treatement, noise reduction, and maybe the implementation of other version of this algorithm to ensure robustness and relyability.
